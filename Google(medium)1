Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given a set of synonyms, such as (big, large) and (eat, consume). Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent.

For example, the following two sentences are equivalent:

"He wants to eat food."
"He wants to consume food."
Note that the synonyms (a, b) and (a, c) do not necessarily imply (b, c): consider the case of (coach, bus) and (coach, teacher).

Follow-up: what if we can assume that (a, b) and (a, c) do in fact imply (b, c)?



Code in python:

s1 = list(input().split(" "))
s2 = list(input().split(" "))
n = int(input())
syno = {}
#print(s1)
#print(s2)
for i in range(n):
    x = list(input().split(" "))
    syno.setdefault(x[0], []).append(x[1])
    syno.setdefault(x[1], []).append(x[0])
#print(syno)
flag=True
for i in range(len(s1)):
    if s1[i].casefold()!=s2[i].casefold():
        flag1=False
        for temp in syno[s1[i]]:
            if temp.casefold() == s2[i].casefold():
                flag1 = True
                break
        if flag1==False:
            flag=False
            break
if flag:
    print("equiv")
else:
    print("not euiv")
